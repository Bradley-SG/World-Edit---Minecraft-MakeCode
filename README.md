--Notes--

This project was made on Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft: Education Edition, due to the limitations of the code engine the project is, in itself limited. This being the case I hve had to work out work arounds and different solutions to add functionality to the project.
Due to the reasons stated above the code can be excrutiatingly slow especially when playing multiplayer.
The sloewest command is the line and the brush tool.
